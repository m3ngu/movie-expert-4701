= Rule =

Rules are rules.

==Methods==

  * `(add-to-closed rule result)` Add the fact list in this result (or a prefix of that list, if match-length is set to something less than the maximum)  to the closed list for this rule.
  * `(closedp rule fact-list)` Test if this list of facts is in the closed list (shortcuts quickly for lists of the wrong length).

))
}}}

==Accessors==

  * pattern-list
  * closed-list
  * action-list
  * match-length
  * exhausted

==Mutators==

  * `exhaust` If this is an exhaustible rule, set exhausted to T.  In any case, return NIL.  (This allows us to limit the number of 20-second exhaustive searches of the working memory that we run.)

= Expert-WM =

Is a partitioned list, that's all...

==Methods==

  * `(add-fact wm fact)`  Prepends new facts
  * `(candidate-list wm fact-type)`  Returns a list that is guaranteed to include all possible matches for that fact type
